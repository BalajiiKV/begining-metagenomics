# beginning-metagenomics

This repo would serve as beginner's path for metagenomics, while myself a beginner trying to figure out the path and constantly pushing resources and pipline materials.

## Concepts and Terminologies

Metagenomics is the study of the genomes of whole biological communities (microbes, human cells..etc.) from a particular habitat. [1]

#### Amplicon Sequencing

Amplicon sequencing is a method of targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) allowing researchers to analyze genetic variations in specific genomic regions using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers designed to amplify a region (regions) of interest in a genome. [2]

The 16S ribosomal rRNA gene in prokaryotes and 18S rRNA gene in eukaryotes is considered as molecular marker for distinguishing.

16S rRNA gene contains 10 highly conserved regions and 9 regions that are variable. In 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of bacteria, the highly conserved region serves as primer while the variable regions helps in identifying bacterial taxas.

The amplified 16S rRNA gene can then be sequenced on one of numerous platforms including:

- 454-pyrosequencing  
- Illumina Hiseq and Miseq
